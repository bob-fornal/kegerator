# kegerator

This is the code and documentation to support my "How to Draw a KEG in SVG" talk.

* The `data-modeling` folder contains work I used to convert an image to SVG.
* The `images` folder are the converted KEGERATOR svgs generated in various ways.
* The `src` folder contains the code portion of the presentation.
